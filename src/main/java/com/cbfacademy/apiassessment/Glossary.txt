@Component indicates a class is a spring Component and is detected and registered as a spring bean when component scanning takes place

@PathVariable like a template literal in js, it takes the variable it is attached to and sends it to its representation in the curly braces i.e when GetMapping ("/{id}/{name}/") public methodName(@PathVariable Long id, String name)

@ResponseBody tells java the controller the object returned should be serialized to json
@RequestBody tells java maps to HttpRequestBody automatically allowing deserialization
