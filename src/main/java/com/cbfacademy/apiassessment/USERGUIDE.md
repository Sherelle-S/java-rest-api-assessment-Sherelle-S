The purpose of this api os to build a watch list where the user is able to have a build a list of stocks that they are interested in using full CRUD capabilities. the user will be able to add a stock its current price and if it is part of their current inventory/how many units. Or if they are just thinking about the stock option.

*Restful* principals:
    CREATE/ POST - Create a new stock to watch
    READ/ GET - Get the data back from the created list
    UPDATE/ PUT - Update whether you have purchased the stock/ sold the stock. How many units and profit or loss.
    DELETE - self explainatory, though may see if i can soft delete the stock.
