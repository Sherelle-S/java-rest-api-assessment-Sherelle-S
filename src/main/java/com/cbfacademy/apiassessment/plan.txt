Here are a list of things that i will need to do


fix test issues, fix ui. 
refactor code again again.
make sure controller and app class are working again.

make new classes and seperate out concerns
- database
- user input
- http requests
- data entry


choose topic
decide on the architecture.
    Java base, Im thinking Spring Boot with a mongodb database. though it would be advantageous to use postgres to be able to say I have experience.
choose database to connect to
I will be connecting to mongoDB it is lightweight, easy to connect to and i have prior knowledge of it. from previous works
create readme.md

Options are a form of derivative financial instrument in which two parties contractually agree to transact an asset at a specified price before a future date. An option gives its owner the right to either buy or sell an asset at the exercise price but the owner is not obligated to exercise (buy or sell) the option.
